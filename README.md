# Deep Learning Learning Repository

## Overview

This repository documents my learning journey in deep learning. It is intended as a hands-on space where I implement core concepts from scratch and experiment with different deep learning algorithms.

## Contents

* From-scratch implementations of fundamental building blocks (e.g., neurons, loss functions, optimization steps)
* Explorations of basic regression and classification models
* Small experiments on synthetic and simple real-world datasets

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is learning and conceptual clarity. The focus is on understanding the mathematics and mechanics behind deep learning models rather than optimizing for performance or production use.

## Status

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated continuously as my understanding of deep learning evolves.

## Notes

* Code is written for clarity and experimentation
* Implementations may prioritize readability over efficiency
